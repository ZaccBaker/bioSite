                    Whether it is for business or personal use, Kevin always enjoys getting on the golf course. 
                    Since a young age it has been both a hobby and a passion of his. When his children were young, 
                    every summer break he enjoyed bringing his two sons out on the course with him. Since then, it has always 
                    been a way for the boys to get out, enjoy the day, and connect with each other. Each person is competitive 
                    in their own right but at the end of it all enjoying the time spent together is what brings them out again and again.

                    Family is and always has been the focus for Kevin. Being the best possible father to his children, 
                    husband for his wife, and brother to his siblings drives him. There never seems to be enough quality 
                    time to be spent when it comes to this. Family meals turning into pure chaos and laughing fits. Movies turning 
                    into vocal arguments with the screen. Sitting on the porch watching golfers go by, quietly narrating with those around. 
                    Going out to watch the latest Marvel movie. It all brings Kevin an immense amount of joy being surrounded by those he loves.

                    If golf is Kevin's hobby then Husker football is his guilty pleasure. Since college,
                    he has been passionate about watching and following the program. Whether through the ups or the downs,
                    he continues to be a steadfast fan. Truly a promoter, he frequently sports Husker apparel either on the
                    golf course or around the house. While he might not say so, those around him tease him as being the Huskers 
                    number one fan. Regardless of the outcome, you can expect Kevin to watch or follow the game and want to talk about it afterwards.
